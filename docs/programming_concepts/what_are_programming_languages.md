## Programming Languages
So now we have a basic understanding of what goes on inside our computer, we can start to understand exactly what you're doing when you write a program in one of the ridiculous number of programming languages available.

You could, in principle, write code in binary and pass it directly to the CPU. However, no sane person has time for that, and in the modern age we instead rely on layered abstractions. It sounds silly, but I understand this by imagining a general planning a war. It would be stupid for the general to go to every point on the front line, and individually order every person under his command to move here, or go there, or attack this. It just doesn't work that way. There's a hierarchy involved to simplify the process for the general, so they can spend their time where it is most valuable: planning the war. In just the same way, it's silly for you, the programmer, to move every individual byte to the required location, and combine them all using any number of instructions native to the CPU.

A programming language allows you to simplify the interaction with the CPU, so you, the programmer, can spend more time ... you know ... programming. You can instead write 'add' and the programming language will take care of translating that for the CPU. How the translation is done depends on the programming language you're using, and is one of its defining features.
