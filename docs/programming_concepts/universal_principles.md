## Universal Principles
There are some ideas that are common across all languages, so I thought I'd better go over these as they're often yet another thing that gets left out of introductory materials for programming. Again, they might seem simple, but having an explicit understanding can simplfy things in the long run. Where I can, I'll give concrete, intuitive, and simple examples using Python.

### How do you actually write programs?
Most often in just a simple text document. You install the necessary software for the programming language you're using, point it at the text file you created, and the software will read through the file assuming it contains code written in the language it understands. For it to do this, the words and letters you type in the text file to make the program must follow a set of rules, collectively called the languages _syntax_.

### Syntax
You actually already understand what syntax is, even if you've never thought about it before. That is, assuming you speak a language, which I hope is the case since you're reading this in English (right?).

Syntax just means the rules of a language, which includes spoken languages. When I was learning German, for example, I could never understand why, when speaking in the past tense, the verb of the sentence goes to the end:

I __love__ Programming! = Ich __liebe__ Programmieren!

I __loved__ Programming! = Ich habe das Programmieren __geliebt__!

_Like, it's just one letter... what's up with that?_ _sigh_

English has rules like this too, and most of us are pretty good about following them. For example, someone could say "I like train". This is grammatically incorrect, because the correct way of saying that would be something like "I like that train". In other words, the initial statement did not follow the rules of English and was, therefore, using incorrect syntax.

Programming languages have similar (mostly simpler) rules and unfortunately you just have to learn them. This will come naturally as you practice writing programs in whatever language you're using, so don't lose patience and keep at it; understanding will come.
