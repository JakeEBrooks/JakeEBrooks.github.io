# Operating Systems
The computer operating system is best described as the primary go-between for you and the computers hardware. Imagine a meeting between two diplomats of countries that don't share a common language. I'm assuming a meeting like that might contain at least three people: two diplomats, which represent you and the computer, and one translator, which represents the operating system.

The operating system, or OS, handles all the functionality that we've come to expect from a computer, like a nice graphical user interface, or managing tasks given to the computer by a human.
