# Fundamental Concepts
This section will not contain any code, we're instead going to be looking at the fundamental concepts behind the computer that sits right in front of you. So take a deep breath and grab whatever beverage is custom in your part of the world because this section will be quite academic.

It is quite remarkable when you sit back and really think about it. The only thing the computer in front of you needs to work is electricity, and yet our entire way of life is built on it. Every aspect of our daily lives only exists because the computer in front of you can work wonders with electricity. Our entire global economy, our governnments, our schools and universities, our hospitals and care homes, our banks and shopping centres... I could go on. All of these only exist as they do because the computer in front of you can do some pretty amazing things with one simple thing: electricity. What, in all the world, must happen between these two points?!

To answer that question, we must start by understanding the machine in front of you ("I'm in shock" I hear you say). In my view, this starts with binary numbers.
