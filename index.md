**Welcome!**

This is intended to be a learning resource and introduction to programming written for people with no prior training in the fundamentals of computer science. This is unfortunately a common situation for undergraduate Physics students, who need to know how to write programs but generally are left on their own to learn how to do it.

**Important! Read before use!**

- **This guide is not a reference manual!**\
It is written and designed to be read from start to finish, *in order*, as though it were a book. You can skip ahead if you wish, but you may miss important details.
- **No matter what the internet promises you, learning programming takes time!**\
I've lost count of how many internet articles and youtube videos make promises like 'Learn Python in less than 5 minutes!'. They are *lying*. Genuine understanding takes time, patience, and a lot of failures. Believe me, I know.
- **This is a personal passion project!**\
Any ads you see are not there of my choosing. I do not want your money. Any opinions expressed are my own.
- **I want to make this site better!**\
