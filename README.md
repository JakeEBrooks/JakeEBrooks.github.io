# An Astronomer's Guide to Programming

This is a beginner's guide to programming in Mojo: a Python-like language. This guide is specifically written for people who want to write good software, but don't have any prior experience in programming or with the fundamentals of computer science, which is often the case for undergraduate physics students. In this guide, I aim to address critical aspects of programming that often go unexplained in the many online resources available on the internet.

Start your programming journey with this guide, and remember to have fun!
